# 🚀 Quick Start - 2 Minutes

## For Users (No Technical Skills Needed)

### Installation

1. **Download** the installer for your platform
2. **Install** the app
3. **Open** Luqman AI Task Manager

Done! Start creating tasks.

---

## Want AI Assistant Integration?

Run this **one command** in your terminal:

```bash

```

Now Claude (or any AI) can create tasks for you in any project!

---

## How to Use

### Visual Interface (Always Available)

1. Open the desktop app
2. Click "+" to add tasks
3. Drag tasks between columns (Backlog → In Progress → Done)
4. Click tasks to add details, subtasks, or start time tracking

### Voice/Chat Commands with Claude (After Setup)

Open any project and tell Claude:

- "Create a task to fix the login bug"
- "Show my tasks"
- "Complete the authentication task"
- "What tasks are in progress?"

Claude automatically:
- Creates tasks in your app
- Uses your current folder as the workspace
- Updates task status
- Tracks progress

---

## That's It!

**No configuration per project**
**No copying files around**
**Just one global setup, works everywhere**

---

## Example Workflow

```
1. You: "Claude, create a task to add dark mode"

2. Claude creates the task in Luqman AI Task Manager

3. You see it appear in your desktop app

4. You: "Claude, mark that as in progress"

5. Task moves to "In Progress" column

6. Click the task to start time tracking

7. You: "Claude, I finished dark mode"

8. Task moves to "Done" automatically
```

## What Makes This Easy?

❌ **OLD WAY:** Copy configuration to every project folder
✅ **NEW WAY:** One global config, auto-detects everything

The app automatically knows:
- Which project you're in (from folder name)
- Where to save tasks
- Which workspace to use

You don't configure anything!
